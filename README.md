FastAPI Backend and React Frontend Integration
This project demonstrates how to integrate a FastAPI backend with a React frontend to build a full-stack web application.

Prerequisites
Before setting up the project, ensure that you have the following installed on your system:

Python (3.x recommended)
Node.js and npm (Node Package Manager)
Setup Instructions
Follow these steps to set up the FastAPI backend and React frontend:

Backend (FastAPI)
Clone the repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone <repository-url>
Navigate to the backend directory:

bash
Copy code
cd backend
Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended):

bash
Copy code
python3 -m venv venv
Activate the virtual environment:

On Windows:
bash
Copy code
venv\Scripts\activate
On macOS/Linux:
bash
Copy code
source venv/bin/activate
Install the required Python packages:

bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Run the FastAPI server:

bash
Copy code
uvicorn main:app --reload
The backend server should now be running on http://localhost:8000.

Frontend (React)
Navigate to the frontend directory:

bash
Copy code
cd frontend
Install dependencies:

bash
Copy code
npm install
Start the development server:

bash
Copy code
npm start
The frontend development server should now be running on http://localhost:3000.
